# CycloneDX Editor/Validator

This command-line tool performs various actions on [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) SBOMs. It allows you to modify, merge and validate your Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

The tool is built with automation in mind, i.e. usage within CI/CD. We try to be as scriptable as possible with various command-line flags, avoiding interactive prompts, providing multiple output options and fine-grained exit codes.

## Command overview

|   Command | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| [amend](https://festo-se.github.io/cyclonedx-editor-validator/usage/amend.html) | Accepts a single input file and will apply one or multiple *operations* to it. Each operation modifies certain aspects of the SBOM. These modifications cannot be targeted at individual components in the SBOM which sets the *amend* command apart from [*set*](https://festo-se.github.io/cyclonedx-editor-validator/usage/set.html). Its use-case is ensuring an SBOM fulfils certain requirements in an automated fashion. |
| [build-public](https://festo-se.github.io/cyclonedx-editor-validator/usage/build-public.html) | Creates a redacted version of an SBOM fit for publication. |
| [merge](https://festo-se.github.io/cyclonedx-editor-validator/usage/merge.html) | Merges two or more CycloneDX documents into one. |
| [merge-vex](https://festo-se.github.io/cyclonedx-editor-validator/usage/merge-vex.html) | *[Deprecated]* Merges the *vex* information in two or more CycloneDX documents into one. |
| [set](https://festo-se.github.io/cyclonedx-editor-validator/usage/set.html) | Sets properties on specified components to specified values. If a component in an SBOM is missing a particular property or the property is present but has a wrong value, this command can be used to modify just the affected properties without changing the rest of the SBOM. |
| [validate](https://festo-se.github.io/cyclonedx-editor-validator/usage/validate.html) | Validate the SBOM against a built-in or user-provided JSON schema. |
