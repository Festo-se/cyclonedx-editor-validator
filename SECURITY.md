# Security Policy

At Festo, we take the security of our GitHub repositories seriously. We encourage the community to participate in identifying and reporting any security vulnerabilities or concerns they may come across. To ensure a smooth and coordinated process, we have established the following guidelines for reporting security issues:

## Reporting a Security Issue

If you discover a security vulnerability or any other security-related concern, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We appreciate your responsible disclosure and will work with you to address the issue promptly.

To report a security issue, please visit our website at [https://festo.com/psirt](https://festo.com/psirt) and follow the instructions provided. Our Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) will review your report and respond accordingly.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you adhere to responsible disclosure practices when reporting security issues to us. This includes:

1. **Providing Sufficient Information**: Please provide detailed information about the vulnerability or concern you have identified. This will help our PSIRT team understand and address the issue more effectively.

2. **Giving Us Time to Respond**: We appreciate your patience while our PSIRT team investigates and resolves the reported issue. We will make every effort to keep you informed of our progress. We aim to process your report within one week, and give you a first response within two weeks. For critical vulnerabilities we aim to resolve them within 90 days.

3. **Not Publicly Disclosing the Issue**: To protect the security of our users, we request that you do not publicly disclose the reported issue until we have had an opportunity to address it.

## Conclusion

We appreciate your assistance in keeping our repository secure. By working together, we can promptly address any security issues and ensure the safety of our users and their data. Thank you for your support!
