"""
This module defines the amend operations which can be performed on an SBOM.

A few general rules for operations:

One operation, one task. **Do not** make a single operation do lots of different things.
This let's users of the tool decide for themselves which changes to make to their SBOM
by selecting the operations to run.

Be mindful of an operation's impact when deciding to add the :py:func:`default` decorator.
Some operations are always safe to run. Others might introduce uncertainty to the SBOM. These are
a judgment call. Others again might add potentially false claims if used without thought.
**Do not** make these run by default.

Examples:
^^^^^^^^^

* *:py:class:`AddBomRef` is safe.* It never does anything to an SBOM that could change its
  meaning.
* :py:class:`Compositions` introduces an intentional uncertainty about the completeness of the
  SBOM's information. *We deem it okay to run by default because at worst it means the SBOM is
  a little less expressive than it could be.*
* :py:class:`DeleteAmbiguousLicenses` introduces uncertainty about the completeness of the
  license claims made for each component. It is meant to eliminate essentially useless
  clutter but consumers of the SBOM could take the absence of license claims in the SBOM as
  a sign that the component is not licensed. *So it should be used with caution and does not run
  by default.*
* *:py:class:`InferCopyright` is dangerous*. It should only be used in controlled circumstances
  - e.g., when it is known that no unintended components will be affected - because it could
  add entirely false claims with legal relevance to the SBOM.

Implementation notes
--------------------

If you want to add additional operations to the amend command, do it like this:

#. Add a new class whose name is succinct and distinctive. It will be used in the CLI.
#. Subclass :py:class:`Operation`.
#. Override the methods defined in the base class, where necessary.
#. Add a docstring to your class.

   * It will be exposed on the CLI so **do not** add any formatting syntax. Stick to raw text.
   * Keep the first line short and clear. It will be part of the general help for the *amend*
     command.

#. If your operation requires additional options provided by the user, add an `__init__()` method.

   * Add any option to `__init__()`'s parameter list. The parameter name will be used as a CLI
     option.
   * You MUST specify a default value.
   * You MUST add a docstring to `__init__()` which describes the parameter. This description will
     be visible in the command-line help text.

#. If you want to add your operation to the default set, add the :py:func:`default` decorator.
   See above about important considerations before doing so.
